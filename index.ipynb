        "#### Original Graph\n",
        "\n",
        "The Graph which I took is about a Poll regarding Feminism\n",
        "\n",
        "<https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/feminism-project/poll/>\n",
        "\n",
        "![](images/img.png){width=\"499\"}\n",
        "\n",
        "**Description**\n",
        "\n",
        "-   The graph uses horizontal bars to compare the percentages of men and women in five feminist belief categories: “Strong feminist,” “Feminist,” “Not a feminist,” “Anti-feminist,” and “No opinion.”\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Men are represented by blue bars, while women are represented by yellow bars.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Icons of male and female figures are placed above the bars.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Percentages for each category are labeled on the bars.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Drawbacks of Original Graph**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Color Contrast:** There is not enough color difference between men's blue and women's yellow. Viewers could find it difficult to distinguish between the two groups fast.\\\n",
        "Recommendation: To improve clarity, use more distinct colors\\\n",
        "**Labeling:** Especially for viewers with visual impairments, the small size of the labels, which include percentages and category names, may make them difficult to read.\\\n",
        "For improved readability, consider using bold text or increasing the font size.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Visual Clarity:** There isn't any obvious hierarchy or grouping. The bars are arranged logically in no particular order, just side by side.\\\n",
        "To make comparisons easier, consider arranging the bars in decreasing order\n",
        "\n",
        "**Gender Symbols:** Using male and female icons as gender symbols creates extra complexity and doesn't help with comprehending the data. It would be simpler to remove the gender symbols from the graph.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Suggested Enhancements:**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Color Enhancement:**\\\n",
        "Improved differentiation can be achieved by using distinct colors for each type.\\\n",
        "**Label Clarity:**\\\n",
        "Font sizes for percentages and category labels should be larger.\\\n",
        "For improved association, place labels by defining the X and Y axes.\\\n",
        "**logical sequence**\\\n",
        "Sort the bars by Types, for example, going from \"Anti-Feminist\" to \"Strong Feminist.\"\\\n",
        "For simpler comparison, combine related categories (feminist beliefs, for example).\\\n",
        "**Get Rid of Gender Symbols**\\\n",
        "To make the graph less cluttered, remove the icons for men and women.\\\n",
        "Instead, make use of legible labels.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Special Efforts:**\n",
        "\n",
        "-   I took into consideration best practices for data visualization, such as color selection, labeling, and logical grouping.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   I concentrated on enhancing clarity, readability, and visual impact during the redesign process.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   An attempt was made to improve the graph's efficiency and simplify it.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Redesigned Graph:**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Original Graph:** The original graph used horizontal bars to show men's and women's self-identified feminist beliefs. But its lack of grouping, tiny labeling, and low color contrast were its problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Redesigned Graph:** For each belief category, I made a grouped bar chart with a different color. Comparing men and women side by side is made easy. The graph is more visually appealing and the labels are apparent.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Patterns in the Redesigned Graph:**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Strong Feminist:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Women (17%) identify more as strong feminists than men (10%).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Feminist:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Women (43%) significantly outnumber men (23%) in this category.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Not a Feminist:**\n",
        "\n",
        "A higher percentage of men (50%) identify as not feminists compared to women (30%).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Anti-feminist:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Very few respondents (both men and women) identify as anti-feminists (5% men, 2% women).\n",
        "\n",
        "**No Opinion:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Men (12%) have slightly more no-opinion responses than women (7%).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Concluding Remarks:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The redesigned graph successfully draws attention to the disparities in feminist beliefs between genders.\n",
        "\n",
        "\\\n",
        "**Next actions:**\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Gather more information to confirm these trends in a range of demographics.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Investigate other factors (such as age and education) to understand differences.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   For more insights, think about creating an alternative plot (a stacked bar chart, for example).\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the redesigned graph provides clearer insights and is substantially better than the original design.\n",
